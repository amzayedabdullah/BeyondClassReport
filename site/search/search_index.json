Most students struggle with practical tools like Git, Linux, Docker, MERN, Laravel, and Spring Boot that are essential in today\u2019s software industry. Because of this lack of hands-on experience, students often feel unprepared, confused, and less confident in real-world work environments.</p>"},{"location":"#motivation","title":"Motivation","text":"<p>Our motivation is to bridge the gap between academic theory and industry requirements.
