# Introduction

## Problem
Today’s university curriculum focuses heavily on theory, but when students enter internships or jobs, they face a major gap. Most students struggle with practical tools like **Git, Linux, Docker, MERN, Laravel, and Spring Boot** that are essential in today’s software industry. Because of this lack of hands-on experience, students often feel unprepared, confused, and less confident in real-world work environments.

## Motivation
Our motivation is to bridge the gap between academic theory and industry requirements. We believe that students should have access to a platform that not only teaches them concepts but also allows them to practice with real-world tools in a guided environment. This helps in building confidence and competence, ensuring they are job-ready upon graduation.

## Solution
**BeyondClass** is a Practical Skills Learning Platform designed to solve this gap. It is a web-based platform built with **Next.js 16** that teaches real industry tools through curated videos, hands-on practice, AI feedback, and certificates.
-   **Interactive**: Students don't just watch; they write code and get graded instantly by AI.
-   **Structured**: The database ensures a logical progression from "Introduction" to "Advanced Concepts" via locked/unlocked modules.
-   **Rewarding**: Visual progress tracking and downloadable PDF certificates provide tangible goals.
